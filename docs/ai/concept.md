# Jobseeker: Product Concept

## What it is

Jobseeker is a personal job search workspace that unifies applications, contacts, and progress tracking into one modern dashboard. It keeps candidates organized, proactive, and data-informed while searching, applying, and interviewing.

## Core jobs to be done

- Track every application, status, and follow-up in one place.
- Keep recruiter and referrer contacts organized with context.
- Capture notes, salary details, links, and interview prep in line with each role.
- Visualize pipeline health and momentum to focus effort where it matters.
- Reduce context-switching across tools by integrating auth, storage, and analytics.

## Target users

- Active job seekers who manage multiple applications at once.
- Professionals returning to the market who need quick structure.
- Power users who want clearer pipeline visibility and follow-up discipline.

## Key features (current/intended)

- Application tracking with statuses, notes, salary, and links.
- Contact management tied to roles and stages.
- Dashboard with charts (timeline, status mix) for momentum signals.
- Kanban board to quickly move roles through stages.
- Auth with social providers for fast sign-in/sign-up.
- Settings for account management and theme preference.

## Value proposition

- Less chaos: centralized applications, contacts, and notes.
- More signal: analytics reveal stuck stages and next actions.
- Better momentum: nudges to follow up and keep pipelines fresh.

## Constraints and principles

- Privacy-first: store only what is required; respect user ownership of data.
- Clarity over cleverness: straightforward UI states and messaging.
- Fast entry: minimize clicks to add jobs, contacts, and notes.
- Trustworthy onboarding: clear outcomes for sign-in/up and error states.

## Open questions

- Which external sources should we prioritize for importing roles (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)?
- Do we need reminders/notifications for follow-ups, and if so, which channels (email, in-app)?
- Should we support resume/cover-letter versioning and attachment storage inside the app?
- What level of collaboration is desired (sharing pipelines with mentors/recruiters)?
- How should we model interviews (per-stage tasks, prep docs, feedback capture)?
